<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h2>Who Should Use This Book</h2>
This book is intended for users who are planning on enhancing the Caudium 
web server or developing applications using the software. This book 
assumes understanding of programming concepts as well as a working 
knowledge of HTML, web related protocols and Pike.

<h2>Before You Read This Book</h2>

materials:

<h1>Conventions</h1>
This section we will attempt to lay out some ground rules that will govern 
the formatting and use of technical terminology in later sections of the 
text.
 
<h2>Double Entendre</h2>
When we discuss terms that may possibly have different 
meanings depending on the context, we will attempt to make 
the meaning clear in material leading up to the use. In 
situations where the are talking about a Pike construct, we 
will use monospace characters to identify this. As an 
example, when you see the word object, which we mean to be a generic bit 
of code, such as a variable or perhaps a generic data structure. However, 
when you see the term <tt>object</tt>,  you should understand that we are 
talking about the specific Pike datatype.
