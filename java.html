<h1>Using Java with Caudium</title>
Caudium supports several methods for working with methods for working with 
Java.

<h2>Servlets</h2>

Caudium supports the Servlet 2.x standard. In order to use servlets with 
Caudium, the version of Pike that Caudium uses must have Java support 
enabled. You can verify this by running <tt>bin/caudium --info</tt> and 
checking for Java in the list of features. The following example depicts a 
version of Pike with Java support enabled.

<h2>Java Server Pages</h2>

Java Server Pages (JSP) are commonly supported through the use of a 
servlet. Caudium is known to work with the GNUJSP 1.0.1. 
<p>
Download and unpackage the GNUJSP package, copying the jar files from the 
GNUJSP lib directory to a directory you'll use to store the servlets, such 
as $CAUDIUM_HOME/local/servlets. Add the paths to these jar files to your 
CLASSPATH, along with $JAVA_HOME/lib/tools.jar. The example below gives 
an example. Note that the full path to each jar file must be included in 
the CLASSPATH statement. After setting the CLASSPATH, Caudium must be 
shut down and restarted (so that the new CLASSPATH setting takes effect.

<examplecode caption="Sample CLASSPATH for GNUJSP">
CLASSPATH=${CLASSPATH}:${JAVA_HOME}/lib/tools.jar:\
/usr/local/caudium/local/servlets/servlet-2.1.jar:\
/usr/local/caudium/local/servlets/openxml-1.2-w3c.jar:\
/usr/local/caudium/local/servlets/sax2.jar:\
/usr/local/caudium/local/servlets/aelfred.jar:\
/usr/local/caudium/local/servlets/gnujsp10.jar
export CLASSPATH
</examplecode>

Create a temporary directory where GNUJSP can save its compiled Java 
classes, making sure that the user Caudium runs as can write to that 
directory. Make a note of this directory, as you will substitute this 
location for the value of the "scratchdir" parameter in the next step.
<p>
Add the Java Servlet Bridge module to your virtual server. Set 
the following parameters to the correct values, as listed below:
<p>
<examplecode caption="Java Servlet Module settings for GNUJSP">
Class Name: org.gjt.jsp.JspServlet 
Code Directory: ../local/servlets (or the directory where you copied the 
GNUJSP jar files)
Servlet location: /jsp/
Parameters:  scratchdir=/var/tmp/
             usepackages=true
             keepJava=true
             compiler=builtin-javac -classpath %classpath%:%scratchdir%:. -d %scratchdir% %source%
</examplecode>
<p>
Save your changes and test the servlet by pointing your browser to /jsp/ 
on your virtual server. You should get a "JSP File Not Found" error. If 
not, verify your CLASSPATH and JAVA_HOME environment variables.
<p>
Finally, to have jsp files automatically handled by GNUJSP, add the 
Redirect 3.1 module to your virtual server, adding the following 
redirect line:

<examplecode caption="Redirect module entry for .jsp files">
glob *.jsp /jsp/%p
</examplecode>
