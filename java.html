<title>Caudium and Java</title>
<h1>Using Java with Caudium</h1>
Caudium supports several methods for working with Java. The primary
interface is to use Java Servlets.

<h2>Servlets</h2>

Caudium supports the Servlet 2.x standard. In order to use servlets with 
Caudium, the version of Pike that Caudium uses must have Java support 
enabled. You can verify this by running <tt>bin/caudium --info</tt> and 
checking for Java in the list of features. The following example depicts a 
version of Pike with Java support enabled.

Caudium's Java Servlet support consists of a module that mounts a servlet
on a particular path in the virtual filesystem, and an internally embedded 
Java Virtual Machine that talks to caudium via JNI (Java Native
Invocation). This allows servlets to run quickly within the Caudium
process, and no external processes are required for servlets to run.
<p>
In order to use servlets in a Caudium virtual server, you will add one
instance of the Java Servlet Bridge module for each servlet you plan to
run. Each copy will mount a given servlet on a particular path in the
virtual server's filesystem. In the configuration interface, this path is
called the "Servlet location".
<p>
There are 3 settings required to connect a servlet to the Java Servlet
Bridge: the class name, the code directory and the servlet parameters. The
class name is determined by the servlet you want to run, and might look
something like net.caudium.servlets.MyServlet. The code directory is the
directory that Caudium will search in for the servlet's class files. See
the next section, Making classes available to Caudium, for more
information about class locations. The third setting, parameters, is used
to pass settings on to the Servlet. The parameters that are available are
determined by the servlet being configured. 
 
<h3>Making classes available to Caudium</h3>

Java classes are typically distributed in one of two methods: class files
in a hierarchal directory structure, or packaged in a jar file. Jar files
are the most popular, as it eases maintenance. However, jar files have a
drawback when used with Caudium: you must place each jar file that is
required by an application in your CLASSPATH before starting Caudium. If
you use plain class files, you can copy your class file directory
structure into the Code directory specified in the Java Servlet Bridge's
configuration settings.

<h2>Java Server Pages</h2>

Java Server Pages (JSP) are commonly supported through the use of a 
servlet. Caudium is known to work with the GNUJSP 1.0.1. 
<p>
Download and unpackage the GNUJSP package, copying the jar files from the 
GNUJSP lib directory to a directory you'll use to store the servlets, such 
as $CAUDIUM_HOME/local/servlets. Add the paths to these jar files to your 
CLASSPATH, along with $JAVA_HOME/lib/tools.jar. The example below gives 
an example. Note that the full path to each jar file must be included in 
the CLASSPATH statement. After setting the CLASSPATH, Caudium must be 
shut down and restarted (so that the new CLASSPATH setting takes effect.

<examplecode caption="Sample CLASSPATH for GNUJSP">
CLASSPATH=${CLASSPATH}:${JAVA_HOME}/lib/tools.jar:\
/usr/local/caudium/local/servlets/servlet-2.1.jar:\
/usr/local/caudium/local/servlets/openxml-1.2-w3c.jar:\
/usr/local/caudium/local/servlets/sax2.jar:\
/usr/local/caudium/local/servlets/aelfred.jar:\
/usr/local/caudium/local/servlets/gnujsp10.jar
export CLASSPATH
</examplecode>

Create a temporary directory where GNUJSP can save its compiled Java 
classes, making sure that the user Caudium runs as can write to that 
directory. Make a note of this directory, as you will substitute this 
location for the value of the "scratchdir" parameter in the next step.
<p>
Add the Java Servlet Bridge module to your virtual server. Set 
the following parameters to the correct values, as listed below:
<p>
<examplecode caption="Java Servlet Module settings for GNUJSP">
Class Name: org.gjt.jsp.JspServlet 
Code Directory: ../local/servlets (or the directory where you copied the 
GNUJSP jar files)
Servlet location: /jsp/
Parameters:  scratchdir=/var/tmp/
             usepackages=true
             keepJava=true
             compiler=builtin-javac -classpath %classpath%:%scratchdir%:. -d %scratchdir% %source%
</examplecode>
<p>
Save your changes and test the servlet by pointing your browser to /jsp/ 
on your virtual server. You should get a "JSP File Not Found" error. If 
not, verify your CLASSPATH and JAVA_HOME environment variables.
<p>
Finally, to have jsp files automatically handled by GNUJSP, add the 
Redirect 3.1 module to your virtual server, adding the following 
redirect line:

glob *.jsp /jsp/%p
