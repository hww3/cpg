<title>Caudium and Java</title>
<h1>Using Java with Caudium</h1>
Caudium supports several methods for working with Java. The primary
interface is to use Java Servlets, though Java Server Pages are also a 
popular option, as well as Pike's support for embedded Java.

<h2>Servlets</h2>

Caudium supports the Servlet 2.x standard. In order to use servlets with 
Caudium, the version of Pike that Caudium uses must have Java support 
enabled. You can verify this by running <tt>bin/caudium --info</tt> and 
checking for Java in the list of features. The following example depicts a 
version of Pike with Java support enabled.

Caudium's Java Servlet support consists of a module that mounts a servlet
on a particular path in the virtual filesystem, and an internally embedded 
Java Virtual Machine that talks to caudium via JNI (Java Native
Invocation). This allows servlets to run quickly within the Caudium
process, and no external processes are required for servlets to run.
<p>
In order to use servlets in a Caudium virtual server, you will add one
instance of the Java Servlet Bridge module for each servlet you plan to
run. Each copy will mount a given servlet on a particular path in the
virtual server's filesystem. In the configuration interface, this path is
called the "Servlet location".
<p>
There are 3 settings required to connect a servlet to the Java Servlet
Bridge: the class name, the code directory and the servlet parameters. The
class name is determined by the servlet you want to run, and might look
something like net.caudium.servlets.MyServlet. The code directory is the
directory that Caudium will search in for the servlet's class files. See
the next section, Making classes available to Caudium, for more
information about class locations. The third setting, parameters, is used
to pass settings on to the Servlet. The parameters that are available are
determined by the servlet being configured. 
 
<h3>Making classes available to Caudium</h3>

Java classes are typically distributed in one of two methods: class files
in a hierarchal directory structure, or packaged in a jar file. Jar files
are the most popular, as it eases maintenance. However, jar files have a
drawback when used with Caudium: you must place each jar file that is
required by an application in your CLASSPATH before starting Caudium. If
you use plain class files, you can copy your class file directory
structure into the Code directory specified in the Java Servlet Bridge's
configuration settings.

<h2>Java Server Pages</h2>

Java Server Pages (JSP) are commonly supported through the use of a 
servlet. Caudium is known to work well with GNUJSP 1.0.1 and Resin. 
<p>
<h3>GNUJSP</h3>
GNUJSP is a freely available Java Server Pages 1.0 compliant servlet. This 
section describes the configuration of GNUJSP with Caudium.
<p>
Download and unpackage the GNUJSP package, copying the jar files from the 
GNUJSP lib directory to a directory you'll use to store the servlets, such 
as $CAUDIUM_HOME/local/servlets. 

Create a temporary directory where GNUJSP can save its compiled Java 
classes, making sure that the user Caudium runs as can write to that 
directory. Make a note of this directory, as you will substitute this 
location for the value of the "scratchdir" parameter in the next step.
<p>
Add the Java Servlet Bridge module to your virtual server. Set 
the following parameters to the correct values, as listed below:
<p>
<examplecode caption="Java Servlet Module settings for GNUJSP">
File extension servlet : Yes
Parameters : 4 lines
Parse RXML in servlet output : No
Servlet extensions : jsp
Class name : org.gjt.jsp.JspServlet
Class path : /usr/lib/java2/lib/tools.jar, 
             ../local/servlets/aelfred.jar, ../local/servlets/gnujsp10.jar, 
             ../local/servlets/sax2.jar, ../local/servlets/servlet-2.1.jar, 
             ../local/servlets/openxml-1.2-w3c.jar
Servlet location: /jsp/
Parameters:  scratchdir=/var/tmp/
             usepackages=true
             keepJava=true
             compiler=builtin-javac -classpath /usr/lib/java2/lib/tools.jar:../local/servlets/servlet-2.1.jar:%classpath%:%scratchdir%:. 
-d %scratchdir% %source% </examplecode>
<p>
Save your changes and test the servlet by copying the file 
<tt>examples/hello.jsp</tt> from the GNUJSP distribution to a convenient 
location in your virtual server's filesystem. Point your browser to this 
file, and verify that the page is properly displayed.
If you get Java compiler errors, verify your CLASSPATH and JAVA_HOME 
environment variables, along with the <tt>-classpath</tt> option in the 
compiler parameter in the Configuration Interface.
<p>

<h3>Resin</h3>
Resin is a Java application server that supports the Servlet 2.3 and Java 
Server Pages 1.2 specifications. Resin runs as a standalone process that 
Caudium communicates with via a socket. The <i>mod_caucho for Caudium</i> 
connects Caudium with the Resin application server using the Resin srun 
protocol. The module can function as either a filesystem module, passing 
all requests for a given location in the virual filesystem, or it can 
be configured to service any requests for a given file extension(s).
<p>
To enable support for Resin, add the <i>mod_caucho for Caudium</i> module 
to the desired virtual server. mod_caucho has 3 settings: the srun host, 
port and extensions that should be forwarded to the srun server. 
By default, Resin's srun interface listens on localhost port 6802. Unless 
resin has been configured differently, these default settings should not 
need to be changed. <i>mod_caucho for Caudium</i> supports load balancing 
requests across multiple Resin engines, and can also parse the output from 
Resin for RXML.

Resin also needs to be configured to use the same  document root as 
Caudium. Resin does not support the concept of multiple  disjoint 
real paths mounted within the virtual filesystem, so this may 
cause unexpected behavior if there are multiple fileystems on a 
Caudium virtual server.

<h2>Jakarta Tomcat</h2>
Tomcat is a freely Java Servlet Container and Java Server Pages 
application server. Tomcat supports the concept of Connectors, which 
allow Tomcat to connect to various web servers through a standardized
communication protocol such as AJPv1.3 (Apache JServ Protocol). Caudium 
provides an AJP 1.3 connector, called the <i>AJP | Tomcat 4 Connector</i>. 
<p>
The <i>AJP | Tomcat 4 Connector</i> is configured similarly to the Resin 
support module described earlier in this chapter. The module provides 
similar functionality for users of Tomcat or the Jetty servlet Engine. One 
current drawback is that the connector does not currently support load 
balancing across multiple container engines.
