<h1>Uniscript: A universal scripting interface</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Are CGI scripts parsed for RXML? Is data returned from the CGI as it 
is generated (I think it is)?

<h2>Compatability Notes</h2>

This section should contain notes describing differences between 
Caudium's behavior and that of other web servers such as Apache.
<p>
Caudium is compliant with the NCSA CGI/1.1 specification. CGI programs that
do not employ extensions to this specification should function properly 
when used with Caudium.

<h2>Examples</h2>

This section should contain simple examples of CGIs, probably in shell, 
perl or pike. Perhaps we should mention how to set PHP up as a CGI(?)
