<title>Request information object</title>
<h1>Request information object</h1>

<p>The request information object (often identified as <tt>request_id</tt> 
or simply <tt>id</tt>) represents the request being processed by the Caudium 
server. The request object contains not only information about the request, 
but also the server environment as well. Since the request information 
object is sent to every module and callback method involved in handling 
the request it is a perfect place for intra-module communication.

<p>
Note that there are actually different request information objects
for different protocols. To the programmer they try to look the same,
but some slight differences might show up.

<h2>Contents</h2>
<p>The members of the request information object are:

<dl>
<dt><b>conf</b><dd>
virtual server configuration object. This field is not necessarily
available when running ordinary Pike scripts.

<p>
<dt><b>variables</b><dd>
a mapping containing all form variables sent in the request, as well
as any additional variables created by modules or RXML tags.

<p>
<dt><b>supports</b><dd>
a multiset containing the features the current browser supports. See
the supports chapter in the creator manual for more information.

<p>
<dt><b>pragma</b><dd>
contains a multiset with information sent by the HTTP header Pragma.
For example, <i>no-cache</i> is a important value, as the presence of 
this pragma means that the request should be fetched without caching.

<p>
<dt><b>misc</b><dd>
a mapping available to store miscellaneous information. Usually used
for intra-module communication or communication between different tags
in the same module. Beware that the name space of this mapping is
getting very cluttered, take care to choose names that will likely
remain unique before storing things here.

<p>
<dt><b>raw</b><dd>
a string containing the the entire raw client request.

<p>
<dt><b>query</b><dd>
a string containing the query part of the URL. It is usually easier to
get information from the <i>variables</i> mapping.

<p>
<dt><b>not_query</b><dd>
a string containing the path part of the URL.

<p>
<dt><b>raw_url</b><dd>
a string containing the whole URL. Note that usually the URL as seen
by the web server does only contain the path and query part. Full URLs
are only used for proxy requests.

<p>
<dt><b>auth</b><dd>
an array containing authentification information. If an
authentification module is present it will contain an array of the
format; <tt>({ successp, username, password })</tt> where successp is
one if the user succeeded in authentificating and zero otherwise. The
password will not be available if the user succeeded in
authentificating herself.

<p>If there are no authentification module present <i>auth</i> will
contain an array of the format; <tt>({ "Basic", basic_auth_info
})</tt> where basic auth info contains a string with the user name and
password, separated by colon.

<p>
<dt><b>remoteaddr</b><dd>
a string containing the numeric IP address of the client machine.
<p>
<dt><b>clientprot</b><dd>
a string containing the protocol version used by the client when
issuing the request.

<p>
<dt><b>method</b><dd>
a string containing the access method specified by the client. This is
usually GET, or sometimes POST when forms are being used. It can also
have other values if you allow methods like PUT, user ftp or use
special protocols such as WebDAV, may try to use various other methods
as well.

<p>
<dt><b>request_headers</b><dd>
a mapping containing the HTTP headers that the client submitted when
issuing the request.

<p>
<dt><b>my_fd</b><dd>
is a Stdio.File object containing the actual network connection to the
browser.
</dl>

<h2>Using request_id for Data Storage</h2>
The request information object is passed as an argument to all module 
callbacks, as well as to all pike scripts and code within the pike tag 
module. Because of this, request_id is an ideal method for inter-module 
communication. Storing information within <tt>request_id</tt> makes that 
information available to all subsequent modules and tags within an 
individual request. 
<p>

<note>
Data that must be shared between requests must use other data 
storage methods, such as the Caudium Cache, or one of the Session handling 
modules.
</note>

The recommended location for storing data for intrarequest communication 
is within the mapping <tt>request_id->misc</tt>. This mapping is not used 
by the core server and has been reserved for the exclusive use of Caudium 
modules and scripting. The use of <tt>misc</tt> is unregulated, which 
means that any code that has access to <tt>request_id</tt> can view or 
alter any data stored within <tt>misc</tt>. When storing data using this 
method, be certain that the namespace you select is unique in order to 
avoid accidental corruption of your data. 

<warning>
Do not store sensitive data within <tt>request_id->misc</tt>.
</warning>

<h2>Examples</h2>
The following script can be used to look at the contents of the Request 
Information object. In order to use it, you must have pike scripts 
enabled.
<examplecode caption="dumpid.pike: a script for viewing request_id">
string parse(object request_id)
{
  mapping res=mkmapping(indices(request_id), values(request_id));
  return sprintf("<pre>%O</pre>", res);
}
</examplecode>
Additionally, the Developer Information module can be used to display 
similar information at the bottom of served pages.
<p>
The second example depicts the use of <tt>request_id</tt>
<examplecode caption="Storing data in request_id">
// Let's make a spot for storing an array of data
//
// First, we should check to make sure we aren't stomping on
// existing storage.
if(!request_id->misc->mystorage)
  request_id->misc->mystorage=({});
// Now we can put something in the array for use later in the request.
request_id->misc->mystorage+=({"banannas", "apples"});
</examplecode>
