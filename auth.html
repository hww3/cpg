<h1>Authentication and Naming</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
Caudium's authentication and name service architecture has been completely 
rewritten for the 1.4 release. The existing monolithic user database 
implimentation has been replaced by a two tier structure of master 
handler and data providers that also impliments native group handling 
functions. This chapter is divided into 3 sections: Public 
Naming and Authentication Methods, which are the well defined APIs that 
developers may use in their own code; Authentication Database Providers, 
which provide access to a naming and authentication  data source; and 
Authentication Method Providers, which provide a method  of retrieving 
user authentication methods from a user agent (client).

<h2>Public Authentication and Naming API</h2>
The Master Authentication Handler module provides a consistent interface 
to the authentication and naming functionality available in Caudium. These 
functions may be used by modules, applications and scripts on any virtual 
server that contains a copy of the Master Authentication Handler. By 
default, this module is added to each virtual server upon its creation. 
<p>

<h3>Properties</h3>
The following properties are contained within the Request Information 
Object (request_id) and are available to any function that receives that 
object as an argument.
<dl>
<dt>mapping|int user
<dd>This element will contain a mapping that is identical to the result 
from auth_module->user_info() for any authenticated user. If the remote 
user has not attempted authentication, or if the attempt failed, this 
element will be zero (0).</dd>

</dl>
<note>Previous versions of Caudium made extensive use of the 
id->auth array. While this element is still available, its use is 
deprecated. id->auth may be removed from future versions of Caudium.</note> 

<h3>Functions</h3>
The following functions that make up the API are contained in the 
Configuration Object (conf). This object is available to all modules, as 
well as any function that receives the Request Information object as an 
argument. See the Configuration Object and Request Information chapters 
for more information about using these objects. Please note that not all 
virtual servers will have a Master Authentication Handler, so it is 
prudent to check for its presence before calling these functions.
<p>
<dl>
<dt>int auth_module->authenticate(string u, string p)
<dd>Attempt to authenticate a user u with password p. Returns 1 on success 
and 0 (zero) on failure. This result (when the user u exists) is typically 
cached for a period of time by the authentication handler.
</dd>
<dt>int get_uid(string u)
<dd>Given a username u, find that user's numeric userid. Returns the 
numeric userid or -1 if the user does not exist.
</dd>
<dt>string|int get_username(int uid)
<dd>Given a numeric userid uid, find that user's username. Returns 
the string username or 0 if the user does not exist.
</dd>
<dt>int get_gid(string g)
<dd>Given a groupname g, find that group's numeric groupid. Returns the 
numeric groupid or -1 if the group does not exist.
</dd>
<dt>string|int get_groupname(int gid)
<dd>Given a numeric groupid gid, find that group's groupname. Returns 
the string groupname or 0 if the group does not exist.
</dd>
<dt>mapping|int user_info(string u)
<dd>Find user information for username u. Returns a mapping containing the 
user's information or zero if the user does not exist. The mapping 
contains at least the following elements:
<table>
<tr><td>string username</td><td>User Name</td></tr>
<tr><td>int uid</td><td>User ID</td></tr>
<tr><td>string name</td><td>Long User Description</td></tr>
<tr><td>multiset(string) groups</td><td>Group memberships, as multiset of groupname</td></tr>
<tr><td>string shell</td><td>Login Shell (optional)</td></tr>
<tr><td>string home_directory</td><td>Home Directory (optional)</td></tr>
<tr><td>string email</td><td>Email Address (optional)</td></tr>
</table>
</dd>

<dt>mapping|int group_info(string g)
<dd>Find group information for groupname g. Returns a mapping containing 
the group's information or zero if the group does not exist. The mapping 
contains at least the following elements:
<table>
<tr><td>string groupname</td><td>Group Name</td></tr>
<tr><td>int gid</td><td>Group ID</td></tr>
<tr><td>string name</td><td>Long Group Description</td></tr>
<tr><td>multiset(string) users</td><td>Membership, as multiset of username</td></tr>
</table>
</dd>
<dt>array(string) list_all_users()
<dd>Return an array of all known users. Returns an array of username, 
which may be empty if there are no known users or if the underlying user 
database cannot generate a list of users. This list is typically cached 
for relatively long periods of time in order to speed response time.
</dd>
<dt>array(string) list_all_groups()
<dd>Return an array of all known groups. Returns an array of groupname, 
which may be empty if there are no known groups or if the underlying user 
database cannot generate a list of groups. This list is typically cached 
for relatively long periods of time in order to speed response time.
</dd>
 <dt>
 </dl>
<note>Previous versions of Caudium supported several authentication and 
naming callbacks such as auth() and userinfo(). While these functions are 
still available, their use is deprecated and may not be present in future 
releases of Caudium.
</note>

<h2>Authentication and Naming Database Providers</h2>

An Authentication Database Provider (ADP) provides access to a database of 
user  and group information to the Master Authentication Handler (MAH) 
module.  The  Authentication Database Provider is implimented as a module 
of type MODULE_PROVIDER. This method allows access to multiple user/group 
databases per virtual server. Additionally,  a virtual server may have 
multiple instances of a given ADP. Caudium includes ADPs for accessing 
information stored in System File (/etc), Active Directory, LDAP, SQL and 
NIS databases.
<p>
When a request for user or group  information  is received, the MAH module 
queries each ADP in turn, until an authoritative match is  found. The 
order in which the  ADPs are called is controlled by  the module priority 
of each Authentication Database Provider. 
<p>
An ADP should not cache data about database entries, as the Master 
Authentication  Handler will cache entries for all ADPs. This technique 
simplifies the  creation of new Authentication Database Providers, and 
ensures a consistent caching scheme.

<h3>Callback Functions</h3>
An ADP must impliment the seven user/group related functions described 
below, in addition to any of the standard MODULE_PROVIDER callback 
functions. The provider module should identify itself as an 
"authentication" provider using the query_provides() callback function. 
The example module at the end of this section describes a minimal ADP 
which may  be used as a starting point for more complicated authentication 
providers.

<h4>Authentication</h4>
<dl>
<dt>int authenticate(string u, string p)
<dd>
Attempt to authenticate a user u with password p. Returns 1 on successful  
authentication, -1 on authentication failure, or 0  (zero) if the user is 
not found  or another error has occurred (a result of zero will not be 
cached by the Master Authentication Handler, so it is appropriate to 
return zero when an authentication source is unavailable or other 
transient error has occurred.)
</dd>
</dl>
<h4>User information</h4>
<dl>
<dt>mapping|int get_user_info(string u)
<dd>
Given a user username, return a mapping describing that user. If 
the user does not exist, return zero (0). The mapping should contain at 
least the following elements, additional elements will be passed 
unchanged to the original calling function:
<table>
<tr><td>string username</td><td>User Name</td></tr>
<tr><td>string name</td><td>Long User Description</td></tr>
<tr><td>int uid</td><td>Numeric User ID</td></tr>
<tr><td>int primary_group</td><td>Primary Group ID (optional)</td></tr>
<tr><td>string email</td>Email Address (optional)<td></td></tr>
<tr><td>string home_directory</td><td>Home Directory (optional)</td></tr>
<tr><td>multiset groups</td><td>Group membership, multiset of groupname</td></tr>
<tr><td>string _source</td><td>result of QUERY("_name")</td></tr>
</table>
</dd>
<dt>string|int get_username(string uid)
<dd>Given a numeric userid, return a string containing the user name. If 
the user does not exist, return 0.
</dd>

<dt>array list_all_users()
<dd>Return an array of all known usernames. The result of this function is 
cached, so this function should return a list of usernames unless it is 
impossible to do so. that is, the length of time required to generate 
this list should not be considered a reason to not return the user list. 
If it is not possible to generate a user list, an empty array may be 
returned instead.
</dd> 
</dl> 
<h4>Group information</h4>
<dl>
<dt>string|int get_groupname(string gid)
<dd>Given a numeric groupid, return a string containing the group name. If 
the group does not exist, return 0.
</dd>

<dt>mapping|int get_group_info(string groupname)
<dd>
Given a group groupname, return a mapping describing that group. If 
the group does not exist, return zero (0). The mapping should contain at 
least the following elements, additional elements will be passed 
unchanged to the original calling function:
<table>
<tr><td>string groupname</td><td>Group Name</td></tr>
<tr><td>string name</td><td>Long Group Description</td></tr>
<tr><td>int gid</td><td>Numeric Group ID</td></tr>
<tr><td>multiset users</td><td>Membership, multiset of username</td></tr>
<tr><td>string _source</td><td>result of QUERY("_name")</td></tr>
</table>
</dd> 

<dt>array list_all_groups()
<dd>Return an array of all known groupnames. The result of this function 
is cached, so this function should return a list of groupnames unless it 
is impossible to do so. that is, the length of time required to generate 
this list should not be considered a reason to not return the group list. 
If it is not possible to generate a group list, an empty array may be 
returned instead.
</dd>
