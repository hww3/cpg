<title>Using the Caudium Cache</title>
The Caudium Cache [the "cache"] first appeared in Caudium 1.3, and is 
an optional facility (that is, you are not required to use it) that may 
be used by a developer to speed server operation and simplify coding. 
<p>
The cache system can be used in pike scripts and server modules, and is 
also used extensively in the core server. Highly modular in design, the
cache system supports multiple storage backends, with memory and disk based
storage currently implimented.
<p>
Most Pike datatypes can be stored in the cache system, with the notable
exception of objects. Because objects can contain code running in the back
end, such as database connection, it is not possible to cache pike objects
using the Caudium Cache.
<p>
The cache is tended to by the cache manager. The cache manager is responsible
for keeping track of operational caches (there may be many in use at a given
time), managing storage and expiring caches that have not been used in a
given amount of time (the "halflife").

<h1>Using the Caudium Cache</h1>
The cache is available from any pike language object (such as Caudium modules
or Pike scripts). Entries in the cache are 
indexed by a identifying string, and you can only have one cache entry per
identifier.

<h2>Getting started</h2>
All of the functions you will need to use the cache are stored in "cachelib".
Simply inherit "cachelib" within your Pike code to gain access to the
various cache system control functions.

<examplecode caption="Inheriting cachelib">
inherit "cachelib";
</examplecode>

Before you can use the cache, you must first request a new cache from 
the cache manager. Once you create a cache, it will be available until the 
server is restarted or the cache reaches its halflife.

<h2>Storing Objects</h2>
<h2>Retreiving Objects</h2>
<h2>Removing Objects</h2>

<h1>Implimentation Notes</h1>
Do not attempt to store pike objects (variables of type object) or other data
types that contain pike objects (such as a mapping of objects). Unpredictable
results will occur.
