<title>Wizards</title>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
Caudium provides a convenient method for generating user friendly 
"wizards". Wizards allow a user to step forward and backward through a 
series of inputs without having to re-enter data. Additionally, the 
Caudium Wizard implimentation allows each page to be validated, preventing 
a user from passing a page where information is incorrectly provided.
<p>
Caudium Wizards can be created using either RXML, using the Wizard 
Generator module, or directly in Pike scripts and modules. This chapter 
discusses using Wizards within Pike. For details on using the Wizard 
Generator module, please consult the Caudium Web Developers' Guide.

<h1>Using Wizards</h1>
In order to begin using Wizards in a module or script, you must inherit 
the wizard library. The following code example describes this process.

<examplecode caption="Inheriting the Wizard library">
inherit "wizard";
</examplecode>

Each wizard consists of a series of "pages", along with a final page that 
is displayed at the completion of the regular wizard pages. Pages are 
generated by creating a function that returns data representing the page. 
Each page function is called in turn as a user steps back and forth 
through the wizard. 

<dl>
<dt><tt>string page_<i>N</i>()</tt>
<dd></dd>
<dt><tt>verify_<i>N</i>()</tt>
<dd></dd>
<dt><tt>wizard_done()</tt>
<dd></dd>
<dt><tt>wizard_for()</tt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
